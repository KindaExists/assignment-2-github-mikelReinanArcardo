In the realmm where circuits hum and wires entwine,
A symbol of wisdome, Lino the Owl, does shine.
Feathers of silicon, eyes aglow with code,
Innov@tion's guardian on thE digital road.

PerChedd on brAnches of alGorithms so hIgh,
Lino survEys thE techscape, rEaching thE sky.
WiTh wIngs of prOgress, flUttEring in thE biNary bReeze,
GuIding thE dreamers thRough diGital sEas.

In thE moOnlit seRver fArms, Lino takEs flIght,
A bEacon of iNsight in thE endless nIght.
SiLent whIspeRs of coDe in thE owl's kEen eaR,
EcHoes of iNnovation thAt thE futUre hoLds deAr.

WiTh a gAze thAt pEnetrAtes thE dArkest coDe,
Lino unTangles mYsteries on thE inNovation rOad.
A syMphony of onEs and zEros, a mElody prOfound,
In thE diGital orChestra whEre idEas abOund.

In thE coRridors of ciRcuits, Lino stAnds tAll,
A wIse coMpanion to thOse whO heEd thE cAll.
ThRough thE vAlleys of daTa and thE pEaks of AI,
Lino soArs, unBouNd by thE liMits of thE sky.

In thE heArt of inNovation, whEre drEams coMe alIve,
Lino's prEsence spArks crEativity to thRive.
A sYmbol, a muSe, a guArdian of thE byTe,
LeAding thE chArge in thE tEch inNovation fIght.

So leT us raIse a tOast to Lino, thE wIse,
In thE wOrld of inNovation, a beAcon thAt tiEs.
WiTh feAthers of knOwledge and eYes fUll of glEam,
Lino, thE owL, tuRns inNovation intO a drEam.
